Welcome to **AiDea**, an advanced platform designed to help you gain insights into financial models for your portfolio by predicting future prices. This tool provides valuable predictions based on sophisticated models but **does not offer specific investment advice**.

## Overview

**AiDea** aims to revolutionize portfolio management by utilizing advanced financial models to forecast future price movements. The platform is built on a solid foundation and is designed to evolve with time, incorporating new features and improvements as the project progresses. 

**Important Notice:** While AiDea offers predictions based on historical data and sophisticated algorithms, **it is crucial to understand that AiDea does not provide personalized investment advice**. Users should seek advice from licensed financial professionals before making any investment decisions. The predictions generated by AiDea are for informational purposes only and should not be interpreted as financial advice or recommendations.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Project Design**
The **Project Design.pdf** document provides a comprehensive blueprint of the project, outlining the initial design and roadmap for future enhancements. This document serves as a living guide, evolving alongside the project.

### 2. **config.py**
The **config.py** file contains essential configuration settings for the Flask application, including database connection details and other critical environment settings.

### 3. **main.py**
The **main.py** file is the core of the application, responsible for creating the **Flask app** and initializing the **SQLAlchemy database**. It also includes a scheduler that periodically cleans up old entries in the `TrainedModels` table to keep the system efficient.

### 4. **models.py**
In **models.py**, you’ll find the implementation of various financial models used for analysis and forecasting. The models include:
- **AR** (Autoregressive)
- **ARIMA** (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **HWES** (Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing)
- **ARCH** (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
- **UCM** (Unobserved Components Model)
- **SARIMA** (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

### 5. **routes.py**
The **routes.py** file manages the communication between the frontend and backend of the application. It defines routes and handlers, ensuring that user interactions are processed and reflected in the web application efficiently.

### 6. **tables.py**
**tables.py** contains the definitions for the application’s database tables. The key tables include:
- **User**: Manages user information.
- **TrainedModels**: Stores details of trained models.
- **Symbols**: Stores portfolio of each user.
- **Temporary Password**: Manages temporary passwords for user authentication.

### 7. **Templates Directory**
The **Templates** directory houses the HTML files that define the structure and content of the web application's pages. These files also include scripts and styles necessary for interactive and responsive user interfaces.

### 8. **Instance Directory**
The **Instance** directory contains the database file. This is where the project's tables and data are stored, providing a persistent layer for the application’s data.
