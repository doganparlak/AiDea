                <h3 style="color: #c9302c;">Common Approach</h3>
                <p> The models consist of parameters that are meticulously calibrated to align with the historical price data provided. 
                    For each model, the algorithm is designed to capture patterns within the historical data that yield the most accurate forecasts, as determined by backtesting results.
                    The AR and ARIMA models utilize grid search for parameter tuning, while the Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator, a form of Bayesian optimization, is employed for HWES, ARCH, UCM, and SARIMA models. 
                    Time series splitting is implemented to facilitate backtesting and optimize hyperparameters. Stationarity is assessed using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and if necessary, log transformation is applied to stabilize variance.
                    Mean Squared Error (MSE) is selected as the loss function, guiding the process of parameter tuning. 
                    Conversely, the AI model differs from the others in that it employs a large language model (LLM), which is fine-tuned using the temperature parameter.

                <h3>AR (Autoregressive) Model</h3>
                <p>The AR model predicts future values based on a linear function of previous values in the time series. It assumes that the current value of the series can be explained by a linear combination of its past values. This model is useful for time series data that exhibit autocorrelation.
                    The parameters tuned in this model include <span style="color: #c9302c;">trend</span>, and <span style="color: #c9302c;">lags</span>.

                <h3>ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) Model</h3>
                <p>The ARIMA model combines the AR model with differencing (to make the time series stationary) and a moving average component. 
                    It is used for time series data that show trends and seasonality. ARIMA models are suitable for series where the past values have a linear relationship with future values and the series exhibits non-stationarity.
                    The parameters tuned are <span style="color: #c9302c;">trend</span>, and order of the model for the autoregressive, differences, and moving average components

                <h3>HWES (Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing) </h3>
                <p>The Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing method is used for forecasting time series data that exhibits both trend and seasonality. 
                   It extends exponential smoothing by adding components for both trend and seasonal variations, making it effective for data with seasonal patterns.
                   The parameters tuned include <span style="color: #c9302c;">trend</span>, the type of seasonal component <span style="color: #c9302c;">seasonal</span>,

                <h3>ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) Model</h3>
                <p>The ARCH model is designed for time series with changing volatility over time, such as financial data. 
                    It models the volatility (variance) of the series and is useful for forecasting future volatility based on past data, making it valuable in risk management and financial forecasting.

                <p><p>The UCM (Unobserved Components Model) is an adaptable framework that decomposes a time series into latent components, including trend, seasonal, and cyclical patterns.
                     Its effectiveness in capturing complex underlying structures makes it exceptionally suited for diverse forecasting tasks.
